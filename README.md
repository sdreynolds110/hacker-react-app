Here you will find a basic (and albeit, incomplete) Hacker News API Search App.

A finished product would include displayed API information from the Hacker News Algolia website, as well as saved user input through React Redux.

To retrieve information, the user will type in the information they wish to receive, and then press the submit button. The API call will display the necessary information below the search bar, where the user will be able to see what they searched for. Because this is an unfinished product, the user is only able to see information in the console that is provided through just clicking the search button.

The technologies used in this app are React, Axios, and eventually, Redux.

Future implementation would include displayed information, and saved user search input through the correct use of Redux
